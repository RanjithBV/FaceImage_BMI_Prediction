# BMI PREDICTION USING FACIAL IMAGES

This project aims to predict Body Mass Index (BMI) from facial images using machine learning techniques. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Instead of using the traditional approach of calculating BMI using height and weight measurements, this project leverages facial images to predict BMI, providing a non-invasive and quick method for BMI estimation.
